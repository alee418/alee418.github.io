# Statistics in Racial Profiling and Police Brutality

20 May 2015
	
## Introduction

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States crime rate has dropped nearly 50 percent within the last 20 years. While some recognize this substantial decrease in crime as a gain in public safety, others still criticize police departments around the country for unlawfully using race to enforce the law (Committee on the Judiciary). Perhaps such disparity in this debate over racial profiling stems from the racial diversity within America, which amounts to the fact that we cannot expect the demographics of the criminal justice system to reflect that of society. However, considering empirical evidence and wide agreement among Americans of racial profiling as a reality for minorities, we must also look further to determine if allegations of unfair policing are valid or just meant to question the current model of policing (Committee on the Judiciary). 
	
Taking into consideration what has transpired in the African-American community within the last year—deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Eric Harris, Jason Harrison, Tamir Rice, and Walter Scott, which have resulted in protests, riots, and greater concern for racial profiling and police brutality—more data should be collected and investigated. For many, these incidents may seem like an “unprecedented wave of police violence,” but to others, particularly those within the African-American community, this experience has been an on-going issue that people did not want to talk about until now (McLaughlin). As a society, we need to have difficult conversations about racial bias, because negative relations between police and their communities can lead to distrust and escalate violence, resulting in increased police use of force (Clay).
	
A closer look at statistical evidence would help assess the extent and problems of racial profiling and police brutality.  Statistical evidence would be necessary for a debate that requires rational discussion and solutions rather than rhetoric and accusations. Transparency could rebuild trust among communities and law enforcement agencies, and reveal effective policing strategies for police departments that need them. Not only are these things important for establishing equal public safety, they also ensure that policemen do not abuse their power to enforce the law (Committee on the Judiciary). While all police should not be perceived as bad cops, the data regarding racial bias in policing and police brutality towards minorities should not be ignored either.
	
## Racial Profiling and Police Brutality

Racial profiling refers to the practice of law enforcement relying on race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in choosing which individuals to investigate and how to proceed after initial investigation. Data from various states showed that African-Americans and Hispanics were stopped for traffic violations much more in excess than their share of the population. Even though law enforcement were aware of these statistics, the trends continued that African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be stopped and searched, but less likely to be in possession of contraband (Committee on the Judiciary).

Most in law enforcement recognize that singling out people because of their race or ethnicity can break the trust necessary to serve and protect their communities (Committee on the Judiciary). Policing strategies like the “broken-windows” tactic, which puts focus on minor offenses to prevent escalation, for example, have led to distrust among minorities in police. This distrust, in turn, leads people to disregard law enforcement, increasing violence and police use of threat or force. Excessive and/or unnecessary force by police refers to police brutality, which has become subject of heated debates within the past year (Clay).

The issues of racial profiling and police brutality came back to life in summer of 2014 when law enforcement officers used deadly force on Eric Garner and Michael Brown. With footage, New York City police were seen choking Garner until he lost consciousness and ultimately, his life. Garner was purportedly selling cigarettes illegally at the time and his death was ruled a homicide (Infobase). About a month later, Brown was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white policeman, in Ferguson, Missouri. Brown, initially stopped for allegedly walking in the middle of the street illegally, was shot to death as he charged Wilson unarmed. Weeks of protests across the nation followed the shooting until a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, which resulted in riots across Ferguson. Just days after that announcement, another grand jury failed to indict the police officer who choked Garner to death as well (Infobase). Not only did these decisions spark debate about how the justice system deals with police officers accused of misconduct, the Ferguson case also called for investigation of the Ferguson Police Department (Infobase).

## Investigation of Ferguson Police Department

Although the Ferguson case did not indict Wilson, further investigation did uncover a culture of police corruption that targeted the African-American community of Ferguson (Infobase). In addition to emails circulated by police supervisors and court staff that stereotyped racial minorities as criminals, the investigation was able to reveal practice of unconstitutional policing. With the help of statistical experts, the Department of Justice was able to analyze FPD’s data on stops, searches, citations, and arrests to reveal patterns of unlawful conduct (United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division). 

Ferguson’s data showed that there were clear racial disparities that adversely affected African Americans. For example, African Americans accounted for 85 percent of vehicle stops, 90 percent of citations, and 93 percent of arrests made from 2012 to 2014 even though they only made up 67 percent of Ferguson’s population (United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division). African Americans were more than twice as likely to be searched during stops even after considering non-race based variables such as the reason for the stop, but were found in possession of contraband 26 percent less often than white drivers. This suggests that police officers were using race as a factor when deciding whether or not to search (United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division). Additionally, from 2012 to 2014, FPD issued four or more citations to African Americans on 73 occasions whereas they only issued four or more citations to non-African Americans two times. For this reason, it appears that FPD brings certain offenses almost entirely upon African Americans (United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division). Nearly 90 percent of documented force such as canine bite incidents were also against African Americans. The disproportionate burden on African Americans cannot be explained by any difference in the rate at which people of different races violate the law, but this investigation reveals that unlawful bias against African Americans have led to these disparities (United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division).

Much like the need to look further into local data to understand the situation in Ferguson, we also need to look at larger sets of data to recognize racial profiling and police brutality at the national level. Seeing as Garner’s and Brown’s deaths were followed by the murder of Walter Scott in South Carolina as he attempted to run away, the shooting of Eric Harris in Oklahoma during a sting operation, and Freddie Gray’s death in Baltimore while in police custody, there are probably many similar cases across the nation that never made headlines and could be of value to this analysis.

## Bureau of Justice Report

Just as it was important to assess the level of racial profiling and police brutality in Ferguson, determining whether or not police brutality disproportionately targets people of color in “post-racial” America would be of even greater significance as it affects all of us. For this purpose, a recent study by the Bureau of Justice called “Arrest-Related Deaths 2003-2009” would be helpful in understanding what policing looks like on a larger scale. As seen in the BJS report, government research often presents data in ways that make critical analysis of the material seem impossible, but by making sense of the information, we can uncover several important details (Kappeler).

As indicated in the report (Table 5) and considering lack of reporting, at least 4,813 people died while being arrested by police. From this total, where race was known, 2,628 or 56.5 percent were people of color. And looking just at deaths classified as homicide (Table 5), 2,876 deaths occurred of which 57.1 percent or 1,643 of the people who died were also people of color. So, seeing that people of color made up less than 30 percent of the U.S. Census in 2010, people of color were not only over-represented in all manners of death here, they were also dying during arrest two times more than their representation in the American population (Kappeler). Clearly, many people of color still experience fatal arrests in “post-racial” America even though this report fails to clarify that. 

The BJS report does well in comparing the total number of deaths to the total number of arrests from 2003 to 2009, but it does not control for lack of reporting by law enforcement agencies and states. Failure to report frequencies or percentages create an impression that deaths during arrest are much lower percentages than they actually are (Kappeler). Rather, it could mean that police brutality happens more often than what has been reported.

## Understanding the Results

Data, as we have found it, might not be an exact or perfect representation of a situation, but when substantial statistical evidence suggests that there is a problem, we cannot ignore the red flags. By looking locally at racial profiling and police brutality in Ferguson and then at a larger scale in arrest-related deaths among minorities, data suggests that people of color are still disproportionately targeted as a model of policing. Once we understand the magnitude of racial profiling and police brutality, we can also recognize that the type of policing seen in Ferguson represents a step back from what the community-oriented policing model has accomplished. As a result, we can push for a better model of policing that increases community involvement and trust, and trains policemen to enforce the law for public safety rather than because they have the power to. Transparency, or the availability of data and interpretation of statistics, would help build this trust and allow for better policing, so that there are less and less news reports about racial profiling and police brutality within certain communities.
